Kinect Body Joints To Minecraft
=========================

This project uses a kinect camera's input to convert body arm and leg joint angles into Minecraft armorstand join rotations.

Useful when trying to animate complex join movements by hand. Instead, one can perform them in front of the kinect and get an output of frames to use in-game.
